 🕒 GUI Analog Clock using Python (Tkinter + PIL)

This project is a **Graphical User Interface (GUI) Analog Clock developed in Python using Tkinter for the UI and Pillow (PIL) for dynamic image rendering. It visually represents the current system time with moving hour, minute, and second hands just like a traditional analog clock.

 📌 Features

* Real-time analog clock rendering
* Dynamic image generation using `PIL.ImageDraw`
* Tkinter GUI with a custom background image
* Continuously updates every 200 milliseconds
* Lightweight and responsive interface

🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Tkinter (Standard Python GUI library)
* Pillow (PIL) for image creation and manipulation
* `datetime` and `math` modules for time and angle calculations

🖼️ Preview

The clock face uses a background image (`cl.jpg`), and draws the clock hands dynamically based on the current system time.

🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install required dependencies (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```
3. Ensure `cl.jpg` is present in the same directory.
4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python clock.py
   ```

📂 Files

* `clock.py` – Main script for the analog clock
* `cl.jpg` – Background image for the clock face (required in the same directory)
* `clock_new.png` – Dynamically generated image that gets updated every 200ms
